They provide constant speed under varying loads and are used in applications requiring precise speed control, such as machine tools and fans.\n","   - **Compound-wound motors** have both series and shunt field windings. They combine the characteristics of series-wound and shunt-wound motors, providing high starting torque and relatively constant speed under varying loads. They are used in applications such as electric trains and printing presses.\n","3. **References**:\n","   - The provided context\n","\n","\n","1. **Answer**: The speed of a DC motor decreases slightly as the load torque increases.\n","2. **Explanation**: As the load torque increases, the armature current increases, which causes a decrease in the armature resistance drop and armature reaction. This decrease in armature resistance drop and armature reaction leads to a slight decrease in the motor speed.\n","3. **References**:\n","   - The provided context\n","\n","\n","1. **Answer**: The significance of back EMF in a DC motor is that it makes the motor self-regulating, meaning it automatically adjusts the armature current to meet the load requirement.\n","2. **Explanation**: When the motor is running on no load, a small torque is required to overcome friction and windage losses. Therefore, the armature current is small, and the back EMF is also small. As the load increases, the required torque increases, and the armature current increases. This, in turn, increases the back EMF, which opposes the applied voltage. The back EMF will continue to increase until it reaches a point where the armature current is just sufficient to produce the torque required by the load.\n","3. **References**:\n","   - Electrical Machines by P.S.
