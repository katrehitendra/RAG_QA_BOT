#  RAG-based QA Bot
This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based Question Answering (QA) bot built using Streamlit for the web interface. Users can upload a PDF document and ask questions based on its content. The system extracts data from the PDF, generates embeddings, and retrieves relevant information using a language model like Google's Generative AI API.

Requirements
Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.10+
Docker (if using Docker)
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your_project
Install Python dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Create a .env file to store the Google Generative AI API key. Example:

bash
Copy code
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
Usage
Run the Streamlit app locally:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Upload a PDF file through the Streamlit interface and ask questions based on the content.

The bot will extract the content from the PDF, generate embeddings, and answer your questions based on the retrieved data.

Docker Setup
Step 1: Build Docker Image
If you want to containerize this application for easier deployment, you can use Docker.

Build the Docker image:

bash
Copy code
docker build -t streamlit-rag-bot .
Step 2: Run the Docker Container
After building the image, run the container:

bash
Copy code
docker run -p 8501:8501 streamlit-rag-bot
Access the app at http://localhost:8501 in your browser.

Step 3: Pass Environment Variables (Optional)
If you need to pass the Google API key or any other environment variables at runtime, you can do so by running:

bash
Copy code
docker run -p 8501:8501 -e GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_google_api_key" streamlit-rag-bot
This ensures your API key remains secure and is not hardcoded into the code or Dockerfile.

Environment Variables
Make sure to configure the Google Generative AI API key in the .env file or pass it as an environment variable.

Example .env file:

makefile
Copy code
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
You can also pass the environment variable directly when running the Docker container.

Technologies Used
Streamlit: For building an interactive web app.
Google Generative AI: For embedding generation and language model-based responses.
LangChain Community: For handling the PDF loading and processing (PyPDFLoader).
Docker: For containerizing the application.
PyPDFLoader: To load and process the content from the uploaded PDF.
Notes
You can modify the requirements.txt file as needed, depending on the libraries used in your project.
The API key for Google Generative AI is critical for making the bot functional; ensure it's correctly set up.
For production deployment, consider setting up a cloud environment like AWS, GCP, or Azure.
